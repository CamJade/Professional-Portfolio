# <Professional-Portfolio>

## Description

This is a portfolio for Cameron White displaying about me, projects, and contact sections. As more web applications are created, they will be placed in the placeholder project spots. 

## Usage

This portfolio website includes an about me section to enable viewers to get to know the author as well as a contact section that links to email, github, and linkedin. 

The projects section is the main section, giving viewers a way to view project samples. As more projects are created, they will be added to the site and when the image is clicked, the visitor will be taken to the deployed application.
