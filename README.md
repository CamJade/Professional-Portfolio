# <Professional-Portfolio>

## Description

This is a portfolio for Cameron White displaying about me, projects, and contact sections. As more web applications are created, they will be placed in the placeholder project spots. 

## Usage

This portfolio website includes an about me section to enable viewers to get to know the author as well as a contact section that links to email, github, and linkedin. 

The projects section is the main section, giving viewers a way to view project samples. As more projects are created, they will be added to the site and will link to the deployed application.
